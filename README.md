**Summary**
This program reads an mp3 (available for download at no cost at [the label's website](http://prettylightsmusic.com/music/)) using the Web Audio API and writes to Wavy Jones, an SVG oscilloscope written by @stuartmemo.

**Bragging**
The Javascript for the audio is written in literate coffescript, which compiles to Javascript. Read more [here](http://coffeescript.org/)

**Future plans:**
Incorporate audio pipeline into an expressive music visualizer
